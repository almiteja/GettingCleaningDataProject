Class Project, Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera

This is my repository for the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data. I have added the following files:

1. A Tidy data set containing means for 66 measurements from the UCI HAR dataset. Each mean (row) is taken from the measurements of a single subject, performing a single task. The measurements (coumns) are the means and std's from each of the measurements taken in the original data set. I have added Activity labels that are descriptive. I changed the measurement names slightly to make them more readable; I wasn't able to make them more clear, as I don't fully understand what they mean.
2. A script that will replicate this data set.
3. A Code Book describing the measurements and how I obtained them.
